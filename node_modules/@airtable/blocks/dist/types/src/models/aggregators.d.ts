 *
 * // To get a list of aggregators supported for a specific field:
 * const fieldAggregators = myField.availableAggregators;
 *
 * // To compute the total attachment size of an attachment field:
 * const aggregator = aggregators.totalAttachmentSize;
 * const value = aggregator.aggregate(myRecords, myAttachmentField);
 * const valueAsString = aggregate.aggregateToString(myRecords, myAttachmentField);
